        <p>I am a software engineer based in Tyrol, Austria.  </p>

      <p>I am holding a bachelor degree in Computer Science and 
         currently I am studying for a Masterâ€™s degree in Software Engineering in Innsbruck.
      My first experiences i gathered working for Onlim as a mainly Backend Software Developer. </p>
      In the meantime i developed small projects for personal purposes 
      like a Android Workout Tracking App,
      or some automatication tools for a better workflow.
      At the University i gained my first experiences with some 
       projects in Web-Development, like implementing a Online Library System or a Online Multiplay Activity Game.
      
      <p>In my opinion Software Engeneering is like building Lego, which i loved as a kid.
      You have different tools and parts at your disposal and you have to create something unique every time.
      That's my philosophy. I combine the creativity 
      it takes with the most modern techniques to develop unique things.
</p>

      <p>To encourage my creativity and when I'm not working on a project, 
      you can find me playing the piano or the guitar. 
      To find a balance, I have been passionate about weight training since I was 15 years old.</p>
      
<p>
I know we live in the Instagram generation, but my favorite, let`s call it hobby, is travelling.
I'm a very communicative person and I love meeting new people and places.
This gives me the most creativity and so I'm always up to date,
which is very important in this industry.
